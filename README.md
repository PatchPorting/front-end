# How to use it

 At the moment, you need to run a user-script (`script-plugin.user.js`) on Greasemonkey for Firefox (not tested on Chromium/Tampermonkey(?), but it should work):
 * Get greasemonkey here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
 * Get the userscript here: https://github.com/PatchPorting/front-end/blob/master/script-plugin.user.js

You donâ€™t need to have a token for just looking around or downloading existing patches. For creating your own patches, you will need a token (since it needs pushing to the DB). To retrieve a token, please contact luciano@debian.org (remember that the platform is in the alpha phase, so proceed carefully).
